    We're games studio and we make games. We're also capable of editing XML files. We can also hopefully edit YAML and markdown.
    
    This is markdown inside YAML, you can:
    
    1. **Add formatting**.
    2. Do lists.
    3. *All sorts of stuff.*
    
    This is the example of a presskit-static configuration. I've included media from a game I made called [Alien Rampage](http://alienrampage.net) because I didn't want to go hunting for stock photos.
